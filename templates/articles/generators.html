        <h1>Python Generators</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Using python generators can really be helpful when you work with a large dataset. This is because computer memory(RAM) is limited.
            It is very common to have very large datasets these days.
            Apart from working with large datasets, maybe you have a complex function that is too small to be modified into a class of its own but the 
            function needs to keep track of its own state. This is where python generators and yeild statement help.

        <h1>Python Generators</h1>
        <p>Generator functions are special kind of functions that return lazy iterators. Unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory.
            Assuming you are familiar with what <a href="{% url 'articles' 'pythoniterators' %}">iterators</a> are, let us proceed. Let us proceed to find out what they are like in action. Let's get to it.
        </p>
        <h3>Example 1: Reading Large Files</h3>
        <p>
            Working with large data streams or large files is a common use case. In our case, we will use a <a href="{% url 'articles' 'csvfiles' %}">csv(comma-separated-values)</a> file. A csv file separates data 
            into columns using commas. Let's assume we have a function csv_reader that returns an iterator that we then pass to csv_gen.
        </p>
        <pre>
            csv_list = csv_reader("csv_file.txt")

            row_count = 0

            for row in csv_list:
                row_count += 1

            print(f"Row count is {row_count}")
        </pre>
        <p>
            Remember to create a csv_file.txt file in the current working directory. Add 3 or more words to each line and separate the words by commas.
            Each word represents a column. Do the same for as many lines or rows as you pleas.
            The function is defined below.
        </p>
        <pre>
            def csv_reader(filename):
                
                file = open(filename)
                result = file.read().split("\n")
                return result
        </pre>
        <p>
            The function opens a file "csv_file.txt" and uses read() function to read a file into a string. The split() function divides the string into items and adds them to a list.
            In my case, my csv file has five lines of text. The code snippet returned 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now download the following csv file and test it using the code above. 
        </p>
